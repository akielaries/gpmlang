# Experimenting for now
Working on a general purpose mathematics language written in Lex, Yacc, and C,
with openGPMP as a core lib. For now plan is to get working enough for quick 
prototyping with openGPMP(and possibly integration with cppREPL?)


# Installation
Requires:
- Flex(Lex) v2.6+
- Bison(Yacc) v3.8+
- gcc/g++ v10+
